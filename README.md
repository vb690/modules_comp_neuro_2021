# Modules

**Modelling Cognitive Functions**  
The course covers fundamental principles and techniques of neuroscientific computational modelling of cognitive functions and their emergence. It reviews some the current and previous architectures aimed at simulating specific higher-order brain functions, such as (visual) perception, attention, learning, memory, decision making, and language, and uses these examples as a way to introduce some of the main open issues in the field. Although different approaches to brain-inspired computational modelling are considered, the emphasis is on neurobiologically and neuroanatomically constrained ones.  
  
**Advanced Quantitative Methods**  
The module builds on the introductory level of statistics and probability theory and aims to provide students with theory and practice in the application of advanced quantitative methods across multiple areas of psychology and neuroscience. Topics include: logistic regression, resampling and monte carlo methods, psychological model fitting, bayesian inference, structural equation modelling, time series analyses, open science tools.
